# Honeycomb

A hexagon grid library made in ~~JavaScript~~[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), heavily inspired by [Red Blob Games'](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) blog posts and code samples.

Honeycomb works in modern browsers and Node (>=16). It's recommended to use Honeycomb with TypeScript, but not required.
