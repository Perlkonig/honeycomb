# Defining hexes

## Orientation

## Dimensions

## Origin

## Offset

In a grid with pointy hexes, each row is offsetted half a hex relative to the previous row. In grids with flat hexes, this applies to the columns. Redblobgames has a [visual example](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-offset).

Set the offset property to `1` or `-1` (default) to control whether the even or odd rows/columns are offsetted.
