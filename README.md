# ‚¨° Honeycomb [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/honeycomb-grid.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/honeycomb-grid) [![Minified size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/honeycomb-grid.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/honeycomb-grid) [![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/flauwekeul/honeycomb.svg)](https://gitter.im/honeycomb-grid)

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is an experimental version and the API ~~is likely to~~ may change. I encourage anyone to try it out and open an [issues](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/issues/new) if you have any suggestions or questions ‚ö†Ô∏è**

A hexagon grid library made in ~~JavaScript~~[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), heavily inspired by [Red Blob Games'](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) blog posts and code samples.

Honeycomb works in modern browsers and Node (>=16). It's recommended to use Honeycomb with TypeScript, but not required.

## Installation

NPM:

```bash
npm i honeycomb-grid@beta
```

Yarn:

```bash
yarn add honeycomb-grid@beta
```

Or download the distribution from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/honeycomb-grid@beta).

## Basic example

Create a rectangular grid of 10 by 10 hexes and log each hex:

```javascript
import { defineHex, Grid, rectangle } from 'honeycomb-grid'

// 1. Create a hex class:
const Tile = defineHex({ dimensions: 30 })

// 2. Create a grid by passing the class and a "traverser" for a rectangular-shaped grid:
const grid = new Grid(Tile, rectangle({ width: 10, height: 10 }))

// 3. Iterate over the grid to log each hex:
grid.forEach(console.log)
```
